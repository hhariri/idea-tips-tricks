 * Why is this an abstract class instead of an interface?
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Java doesn't support extension methods and there are many overload methods needing default implementations.</li>
 * <li>Virtual extension methods aren't available until Java8 which RxJava will not set as a minimum target for a long time.</li>
 * <li>If only an interface were used Scheduler implementations would then need to extend from an AbstractScheduler pair that gives all of the functionality unless they intend on copy/pasting the
 * functionality.</li>
 * <li>Without virtual extension methods even additive changes are breaking and thus severely impede library maintenance.</li>
