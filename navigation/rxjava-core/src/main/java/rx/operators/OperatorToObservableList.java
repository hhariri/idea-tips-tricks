/**
 * Returns an Observable that emits a single item, a list composed of all the items emitted by the
 * source Observable.
 * <p>
 * <img width="640" src="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/wiki/images/rx-Observers/toList.png">
 * <p>
 * Normally, an Observable that returns multiple items will do so by invoking its Observer's
 * <code>onNext</code> method for each such item. You can change this behavior, instructing the
 * Observable to compose a list of all of these multiple items and then to invoke the Observer's
 * <code>onNext</code> method once, passing it the entire list, by using the toList Observer.
 * <p>
 * Be careful not to use this Observer on Observables that emit infinite or very large numbers of
 * items, as you do not have the option to unsubscribe.
